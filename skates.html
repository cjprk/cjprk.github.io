<p>In Soft Tech Sublimate, a pair of Softec skates is embedded in a block of ice. Laden with contact microphones, the bucket beneath  amplifies the falling droplets, distorting the backing music. Viewers are confronted with a space that oscillates between calm and calamitous. 

<p>My installation/sculptural work is concerned with questions of ecology, death and data.

<p>Special thanks to Marley Kirton and the 2017 Granoff Spring Arts Festival
