<p>The devices we entrust with our memories age as we do. This film follows the protracted death of an iPhone 6s. Registering its revival on the same DV-tape used to film my grandmother's funeral ceremony, <b>loss/lessness</b> is an attempt to overcome the life-death threshold and stand against the current of time.

<p>The protagonist of W G Sebald’s <u>Austerlitz</u> underlines an important complication with recorded memory. In search of the mother he never knew, Austerlitz pays a visit to the viewing room in Prague's Imperial War Museum. Slowing the footage of a propaganda film to four times its speed, he finds that degrees of access succumb to the pressures of time. This act of temporal quartering allows Austerlitz to register death as the machine pushes the sounds of the film into a “subterranean world..." Memory and material degradation produce new modes of interaction with the things we wish to relive or remember:
 
<p> “...the longer I think about it the more it seems to me that we who are still alive are unreal in the eyes of the dead, that only occasionally, in certain lights and atmospheric conditions, do we appear in their field of vision”.

<p>Do we continue to categorize “phantom traces” as illusions? Is it not in the phantom traces that instants of our selves, among the living and the dead, might reappear?
