<p>i) <b>廢青</b>, 2019

<p> a derivation of "頹廢青年" ("wasted youth"), the pejorative 廢青 (fai cing) encapsulates hong kong's brand of milennial disdain.
 a reclamation of the pejorative "廢青", this film pries open the colloquialism, re-distributing its connotations that span color, flora, decay and abandonment. <p>the end of the world does not distinguish between plant life and digital detritus. an exemplar of the city as interface, hong kong provides the setting for this reverse-terraforming project, and an opportunity to think about growing out of the city's ruins.


<p>ii) <b>loss/lessness</b>, 2018
<body>
<p>the devices we entrust with our memories age as we do. this film follows the protracted death of an iPhone 6s. recording its death and revival on the same DV-tape that was used to film my grandmother's funeral ceremony, <b>loss/lessness</b> presents an attempt to stand against the current of time
