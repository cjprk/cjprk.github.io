<b>loss/lessness</b>

<p>The devices we entrust with our memories age as we do. This film follows the protracted death of an iPhone 6s. Registering its revival on the same DV-tape used to film my grandmother's funeral ceremony, <b>loss/lessness</b> is an attempt to overcome the life-death threshold and stand against the current of time.
