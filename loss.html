<b>廢青</b>, 2017

<p> a derivation of "頹廢青年" or "wasted youth", the term 廢青 (fai cing) emerged more recently as hong kong's brand of millennial hate. a reclamation of the pejorative "廢青", this film pries open the cantonese colloquialism, re-distributing its connotations spanning color, flora, decay and abandonment. 


<p>the end of the world does not distinguish between plant life and digital detritus. an exemplar of the city as interface, hong kong provides the setting for this film as a reverse-terraforming project, and an opportunity to think about growing out of the city's ruins.


<p><b>loss/lessness</b>, 2017
<body>
<p>the devices we entrust with our memories age as we do. this film follows the protracted death of an iPhone 6s. registering its revival on the same DV-tape used to film my grandmother's funeral ceremony, <b>loss/lessness</b> is an attempt to overcome the life-death threshold and stand against the current of time.
