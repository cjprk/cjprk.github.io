<p> 
Raised in Hong Kong and educated between England and the US, I have had to reckon with cultural outsiderness from different climates and altitudes.

An observer and listener, I derive inspiration from following and forecasting trends in visual culture. I am empowered by the prospect of harnessing new technologies to share stories and ideas with the world.

tldr;
I am constantly in search of the best way to really reach someone.
