<h2>
<p> a writer with a working knowldge of digital media, i have explored ideas on ecology, memory, big data, race and food through text, film and installation. 

<p>
raised in hong kong by two korean parents and educated on either side of the atlantic, my time on this planet has been punctuated by the privilege of movement. i have continuously had to observe, listen, and adapt in order to communicate across boundaries.

<p> this might explain why sujin jang's ideas re: <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-most-creative-teams-have-a-specific-type-of-cultural-diversity"> cultural brokerage</a> resonate with me. i can attest that "cultural outsiderness" can not only facilitate but also amplify the flow of ideas. 

i am interested in cultural conversations, in storytelling and branding. 

<p> a recent graduate of brown university's modern culture and media program, i come equipped with:
	<p> ¶ a foundation in critical thinking, writing and research
	<p> ¶ a working knowledge of developments in the tech and media space
	<p> ¶ a proficiency in digital media and video production
